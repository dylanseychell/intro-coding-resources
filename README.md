# Introduction to Coding - Resources
An open source repository with a variety of resources to help anyone to get started in coding.

In this space, you can find a selection of notes and examples to get started with programming.  For now, this repository will contain Processing resources.  Visual programming is an awesome way to get started with coding since it gives immediate feedback.  Processing makes this even better due to the tollerance it gives to whoever is coding, relieving us from the normal strictness that is associated with programming languages.

You can download Processing for free from: https://processing.org/download . This software is freely available but if you feel like/afford contributing, go ahead, it's a great project.

Enjoy it and please share!  If you are a confident coder, you are also encouraged to make use of these resources and help others get started!
